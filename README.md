# Peak Resource Utilization Analysis Script

## Overview
This Python script analyzes resource utilization data from a Cloudera cluster to identify periods of peak memory and CPU (vcore) usage. It processes application data, including memory seconds and vcore seconds, to determine peak concurrency windows and overall resource utilization during these periods.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Access to a Cloudera cluster with application data available through the Cloudera Manager API.


## Setup
1. **Install Python Dependencies**: Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system and install the `requests` library using pip:
2. configure sizing.conf
